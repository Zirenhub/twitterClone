# Description
This project is a clone of the popular social media platform Twitter, built using React as the front-end framework, Styled Components for styling, and Firebase as the backend database. The project includes key functionality such as posting tweets, replying to tweets, liking tweets, and retweeting. Each tweet has a count for comments, likes, and retweets. Users also have their own profiles where they can view their tweets(including retweets), replies, and liked tweets. Additionally, the project includes a following and followers system, allowing users to follow other users. Users can also message those they follow or those who follow them.
